# Smart-Home
This project uses OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time hand gesture recognition. It tracks 21 hand landmarks to detect gestures like finger counting and pinching. The system communicates with an Arduino to control hardware based on detected gestures, enabling intuitive, touch-free interaction.
